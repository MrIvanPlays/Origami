## Why no API additions
(Copied from [starlis/empirecraft](https://github.com/starlis/empirecraft/))
<p>
API's are tough to design. In public projects such as Bukkit, Spigot, Sponge etc, once an API is commited. It's almost forever. You can't go breaking it without solid justification. This is the politics game.

With that in mind, much thought has to be given to the API in now and future use cases and applications to ensure it can be extended without breaking.

This is a lot of politics that we don't have time in our lives to deal with.
